# New Dawn Coalition Player Rulebook

# Beta Phase

The server is currently in beta, meaning sudden and wild changes to basically everything are possible. We're happy with most of what we have, but nothing is set in stone, and we're open to feedback on every part of the server.

That said, we will be making the server public sometime in the near future, and when that occurs **we'll be doing a full wipe of all characters, rewards, items, etc.** You're free to recreate your character to continue playing them when that occurs, but every character will go back to the starting level, gold, items, etc.

# Introduction

> The Sundering left the world broken. Our forebears coveted ever-increasing power, and we still feel the gods' punishment decades later. We are rebuilding, but our situation is dire.
> 
> We have reclaimed one of the floating cities. We call it Solace. Our guild, New Dawn Coalition, was founded by "Reggie", General Regina Stone, a firbolg commander who led part of the resistance against the forces of the divine during The Sundering, and The Sage, an ancient being bound to the artifact which keeps the city afloat.
> 
> We have merely survived until now. Now, we take back our world.

## Code of Conduct

We can't list our every possible thing people could do that's unacceptable. People can be creatively awful, and for the sake of brevity, this is deliberately brief. That's not an endorsement to be a jerk until someone makes a formal rule prohibiting that particular style of jerk.

We're all here to play D&D, have fun, make friends, etc. Our staff volunteer their time to make this possible, and punishing people is something we didn't sign up to do. If you happen to cross some line, since this is deliberately vague, we'll clearly communicate to you the issue, and we can all move on. If there's a pattern of poor behavior, the punishments will escalate quickly, with a server ban being the final punishment.

This is a diverse server, and we're accepting of any and all people. You'll probably encounter someone you don't like for some reason. That's ok. There's plenty to do here. Remember, they're here for a good time, too. We're all flawed, and we all know it. Be a good person to everyone, be honest, be kind, and you'll be fine. This is not a place for any kind of hate. Keep your behavior appropriate for an age 16+ server. If you're unsure if something is ok or not, reach out to staff and ask before you do it, or just don't do that thing. Both are valid choices.

## D&D

Dungeons & Dragons is a game created between DMs (dungeon masters) and players. DMs set the scenes, and players interact, solve problems, overcome adversity, and accomplish a number of objectives that are impossible to entirely enumerate.

There's rules for what each character can do, and most outcomes are determined by rolling a 20-sided die (commonly called "d20"). It'll make you laugh, cry, feel shock, betrayal, terror, and probably every other emotion. It's pretty great, and if you're new, we hope you come to enjoy it as much as we all do.

If you are new, this is a good place to start. We want to introduce as many players to our favorite game as possible, so fear not, we're here for you!

## West Marches

So, what is West Marches? D&D originally started between small groups of friends, playing in person, for months or years. What if you had 20 friends who wanted to play? Or 200? And what if several of them all wanted to be DM occasionally?

These are the questions "West Marches" answered. West Marches is a D&D game where numerous DMs run whenever they can, grabbing whichever players are available for the game, and the entire community interacts in a shared world in unique ways. It's a different way to play, but it works, it's incredibly convenient, and offers a lot that traditional games cannot.

## How to Play

Players will communicate through a Discord voice channel and play on the [Roll20 Virtual Tabletop website](https://roll20.net/). To play with us, you'll need a free Roll20.net account, a microphone, and a reliable internet connection. It may take some time to get used to some of Roll20's features. If you need help, please reach out!

## Joining the Server

After joining the server, you'll have a few steps to complete before you're ready to start playing.

### Request a quiz

Request a quiz in `#request-quiz` by copying and pasting the pinned message in that channel. Read the Rulebook for answers. After this step, head to `#request-sheet`.

### Request a character sheet

Go to `#request-sheet` and join the Roll20 game room pinned in that channel, then request a sheet by copying and pasting the pinned message in that channel, customizing it with the specified details.

### Build your character

Build your character. This process mostly follows rules-as-written, but be sure to read through [Character Creation](#Character Creation) for any changes. After this step, head to `#request-review`.

### Submit your character for review

Request a character review in `#request-review` by copying and pasting the pinned message in that channel. From here, you'll be able to join games.

### Request Barracks assignment

Go to `#request-barracks` and join the Roll20 game room in the pinned message there, then paste the message that's also part of that pin (customizing it with the specified details). Your sheet will be reviewed by another scribe, and if everything looks good, you'll be given access to your sheet and you'll be ready to start playing!

*Leave the Recruitment Room after this step is complete, as it'll keep that room from being laggy for others.*

### Find available games

Look for the category labeled **contracts** for available contracts, and head to `#rallying` to rally allies for the mission.

### Join or create a party

Read the rules and guides in [Joining Games](#Joining Games) for information on this process.

## Character Creation

### Rules As Written

Follow rules as written (RAW) whereever it applies. Any deviation from RAW will be specified here.

> For example, Customizing Your Origin from TCE is allowed as it's RAW.

The only alternative to this is when old material is reprinted in new books. In these instances, use the most current book's content (so long as the book is on the [Sources Allowed list](#Sources Allowed list).

> For example, if a race has been updated in MPMM, use the MPMM version of that race.

### Personality

Fill our the sections labeled Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, as well as something for Character Backstory in the Bio tab. You're free to adjust these sections at will as your character grows and develops.

We're lenient on the character you want to play, but keep in mind, members of the guild are typically upstanding, valuable members of Solace. Reckless criminal acts will not be rewarded, and could be severely punished in extreme circumstances, so keep this in mind when developing your character's personality and behavior.

### Ability Scores

Ability Scores are determined using the 27-point buy system. You can use a site like [Chicken Dinner](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) to determine stats this way.

### Customizing Your Origin

[Custom Origin options](https://5e.tools/variantrules.html#customizing%20your%20origin_tce), as they appear in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, are allowed. You are allowed to allocate your +2 and +1 to any attributes, but they cannot be used on the same one.

### Hit Points

Hit points are determined by rules as written, meaning you take the max of your first level's hit die and add your constitution modifier to it for the first level, and the second level is the average of the hit die (rounded up) plus your constitution modifier.

> For example, a PC with two levels in fighter and a +3 constitution modifier will start with 22 HP (First level = 1d10 + 3 = 13 HP. Second level = 6 + 3 = 9 HP. Total = 13 + 9 = 22 HP).

### Starting gold and equipment

Players start with the starting items from your class, then the gold from your background. Players are not allowed to buy or sell items until your character sheet has been assigned to you in the barracks.

### Helping the Scribes

There's a few things you can do when building your character to make your character review go quicker:

1. You'll find an entry under Features & Traits (bottom right) on your sheet. Fill in the fields provided as follows:
   a. Your starting stat array.
      i. e.g. STR 8, DEX 15, etc.
   b. Your race and where Racial bonuses were used.
      i. e.g. High Elf and decided status bonus of +2 +1 as per Tashas.
   c. Your skill choices and their sources.
      i. e.g.: Artificer: Arcana, History.
      ii. Urban Bounty Hunter: Deception, Insight
      iii. High Elf: Perception
   d. Starting gear choices.
      i. e.g. Artificer: 2 daggers, a light crossbow and 20 bolts, scale mail, thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack.
      ii. Urban Bounty Hunter: A set of clothes appropriate for....
   e. Any other choices and their sources.
      i. e.g. Tools, Languages, etc.
2. After your character is assigned a barracks you can delete this entry.

### Images and GIFs in Character Sheets

Don't add images or GIFs to your character sheet. It can lag out the game for others.

## Retraining

Players can retrain their character once while level 2. Possible changes can include your class, starting attributes, backgrounds, feats, or race. This is for the players' benefit, but don't try to abuse this. This does not mean you can take a class, sell all the starting gear, and retrain into a new class and then sell that gear too. Any attempted abuse of this will be reverted, and the player will face punishment. If you're not sure if something is allowed, please ask a member of staff.

# Playing

## Behavior

Everyone is here to have fun. Be a good player. That's very vague, but in the context of games, DMs are responsible for their tables. That means they get to decide how rules are interpreted, what behavior is acceptable and what isn't, details on the world, NPCs, pacing, and numerous other details that aren't needed to be spelled out. Trust your DMs, and accept their decisions. If you find you don't enjoy a DM's style, that's ok, we have many DMs you can play with.

If a DM crosses a line, save that for feedback at the end of the session, or open a ticket to bring it to the attention of the admins and mods. Don't derail games. Don't argue with DMs. Don't tell them how things should be. DMs have complete freedom in deciding to table ban players (meaning those players are no longer allowed to play in their games). This is a game, it's supposed to be fun, and it's really not serious enough to get into arguments over.

## Magic Items

`Initiate` characters are only allowed to use Common magic items in their games. `Initiates` can purchase higher rarity items, but they can't use them until they reach `Adept`.

## Joining Games

To join a game, first look for the `Contracts` category. It should look something like this:


The channels in this section are available contracts. They're formatted as difficulty-tier-date-dm. The difficulty will be either Lunar or Solar, the tier will be either Initiate, Adept, Vanguard, Exemplar, or Harbinger, the date is the day the game is happening, and the DM is the Dungeon Master running that game.

You can find brief contract descriptions in `#contracts`, and you can chat with players in `#rallying` to join lists or find people to join a list you've created.

### Game Difficulty

Games are designed for specific tiers (Initiate, Adept, Vanguard, Exemplar, Harbinger), and within each tier you'll find Lunar and Solar variants. Lunar missions are balanced at the low end of a tier, Solar at the high end. You'll get better rewards in Solar, but missions will be much harder, and you'll find Lunar games easier, but the rewards are lower. Both reward the same experience for PCs, so players who want an easier experience can play Lunar all the way to level 20, or Solar for a harder experience, or whatever mix they prefer.

## Joining a List

If you find a contract that you can play (appropriate tier, time, etc), head to `#rallying` and @ the person who made the list (listmaker or LM). It's helpful to # the channel of the game, so they know which game you're referring to and they can click the # to jump to the channel immediately. It helps to let the LM know your character's role, particular skills they bring, etc. You might message in `#rallying` something like:

"Hey @strafe, would you like a front line GWM for #s-init-feb-22-gg?"

### Creating a List

To create a list, go to the contract channel (the channels that start with a date under contracts), and look at the details of the contract: the Chronus for the time of the game, the number of players, and any tags. Copy or type out the number of players, and post it in the contract channel. As people @ you in `#rallying`, add those who you want to your party. You're not required to add in any particular way (don't have to add the first people, don't have to add people who haven't played in a while, etc.) If you're a LM, it's your choice on who you bring.

### Multi-listing

Some DMs allow multi-listing, which allows a player to be on more than one list. The DM will specify this in the contract description, so look for this detail before attempting to join more than one list. The server maximum for multi-listing is 3, so you can never be on more lists than this amount. Some DMs don't allow multi-listing, or enforce a lower limit on multi-listing.

### List Selection

The DM will specify when they will pick the winning list. If the list you're on is chosen, congrats! You have a game! Please read any additional details in the contract channel, join the DM's gameroom, and import your character sheet.

If you're the LM and your list wins, make sure your team is pinged as soon as you're able to let them know they have a game coming up.

### Slow Mode

Players may choose to go "slow mode" and abstain from taking their mission XP and receiving half the gold reward. Players that opt for slow mode may still receive end of mission rewards as normal. Communicate this to the DM before, during, or immediately after a game concludes. DMs will honor slow mode requests up to 24 hours after a game concludes.

## If you Died

If you die on a contract, all hope is not lost. You can be revived, so long as the components can be provided for the revival spell. There's no roll - no fading spirit, nothing like that. If you want to keep your character, that choice is yours, so long as you can afford the resurrection (or raise the gold to pay for it).

Do note, if your body cannot be brought back to the guild, resurrection will not be possible. Some DMs may create a "rescue contract" in the event of lost character(s), but they are not required to, so don't pester them to.

DMs know it hurts to lose a character, and they know players will want a rescue contract, so they don't need to be reminded.

# Out of Game

## Updating Your Character

### Leveling

Leveling happens immediately after playing enough games at your tier.

Our XP system is customized, based on a number of games equal to your PC's proficiency bonus + 1.

> e.g. a level 5 PC needs 4 games to level, as well as a level 6, 7, and 8 PC. At level 9, the number of games to level increases to 5.

When you level, load the barracks your PC is stored in and make all the changes yourself (such as new class features, HP increases, new spells, etc.). When you reach a new tier, an audit of your gold will occur. Feel free to ask staff for help regarding this. You won't be able to play until this is completed.

||Tier||Character Levels||Games per level||
|Initiate|2 - 4|3|
|Adept|5 - 8|4|
|Vanguard|9 - 12|5|
|Exemplar|13 - 16|6|
|Harbinger|17 - 20|7|

After leveling up, head into the Barracks your character is in and make the changes there. This usually includes things such as:

- HP increase
- Class features
- Proficiency bonus (if you're reaching levels 5, 9, 13, or 17)
- New spells (if applicable)
- Increases in older class features (e.g. Bardic Inspiration increases at certain levels, Battle Masters get more maneuvers and increased Superiority Dice, etc)


_Note: It's important to remain in the Barracks your character is in so you can edit your sheet upon leveling up. If you leave that roll20 gameroom, your access to the sheet is automatically broken. New Barracks are created as they fill up, so finding your Barracks again can be difficult._

### Audits

D&D relies on people acting in good faith and honesty. Unfortunately, these concepts are hard for a small portion of the world. As such, you are required to keep an accurate log of your gold, experience, items, and contract records. We have created a template to make this convenient for players as well as staff to verify periodically. You can find the [Player-Inventory template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noId6CsGkQ-l5OR0aO9k1cfGyqeKVPLxpmK2gzhr7_4/edit). Click File, Make A Copy, and update it after every game, every trade, every purchase, and any other exchanges of gold. Audits will be performed randomly, and if a member of staff asks to see your Inventory, it must be provided and be up to date. Failure to do so, or if there's large discrepancies, you will be unable to play, trade, use downtime, or engage in any activity that affects your Inventory until it is made current.

When leveling up to a new tier (upon reaching level 5, 9, 13, and 17), a mandatory audit will be performed to make sure everything is in order and to catch any issues before they snowball into more.

Accounting is not fun for most of us. Mistakes will be made. You won't be punished or suffer any adverse effects if you're responsible for your character and putting in honest effort to keep track of your resources.

## RP

Roleplaying that is explicity sexual is not allowed. This server is 16 and above. Romance is fine, but erotic roleplay is not. No more than holding hands, blushing, and kissing. Roleplaying is a privilege, and if you're not sure if something is allowed, please reach out to staff and make sure. Any problematic behavior in RP is something we will not tolerate, and is certainly a situation where it's better to ask staff for permission rather than for forgiveness.

## Markets

In the markets of Solace, as an adventurer you can purchase basic goods, mundane gear and weapons and spell components. These such things can also be solve to The Market at 50% of PHB cost (rounded down). Gems may be sold for full price.

Inside the Auction Bazaar, you can trade between other Player Characters for items, services, and other magical goods. Trading between other players must have an exchange of items, gold or otehr goods that have monetary value. This is further explained blow.

## Trading

*Rules, restrictions, expectations, etc.*

## Downtime

Each day URL, characters accrue 1 DT (downtime). These can be used for a variety of activities which can provide gold, items, buffs, and more. Each contract taken costs a character 1 DT. To take part in a downtime activity, find the channel `#downtime` in the **Downtime** category in discord, then post a message stating which activity you'll be performing. For all information on the DT options, refer to the [Downtime](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDL0YEbT8Yk8WlsRJ4tZsoQJmgcHCtMS0mNj1BxS8kk/edit) document.

## Records

### Contract Records

### Character Backup

We'd **strongly** recommend keeping an up-to-date version of your character in the roll20 Character Vault section at all times. Most of you probably do this already, but we've heard of another server losing **all** their PCs when a server at roll20 died (imagine if the roll20 server that stores our Barracks were to die).

This isn't something to worry too much about, but it has happened apparently, and we wanted to warn everyone and give a suggestion to try to prevent it from happening to your PC.

Other things players can do out of game

## Retiring

You can retire your character by making a request in `#retirement`. After your retirement is processed, you may begin the character creation process from `#request-sheet`. Before you make the Retirement request you need to be removed from any lists you're currently on, and you're unable to join or create any lists until your new character is approved.
